# HymoFS Technical Documentation

## Overview
HymoFS is a kernel-level path manipulation and hiding framework designed for advanced overlay and modification capabilities on Android. Unlike traditional overlay filesystems, it operates by hooking directly into the Linux kernel's VFS (Virtual File System) layer to intercept and modify file operations transparently to userspace applications.

## Control Interface
Communication with the kernel module is handled via the character device node:
`/dev/hymo_ctl`

The communication protocol uses standard `ioctl` system calls, defined in `fs/hymofs_ioctl.h`.

### Commands (IOCTL)

All commands are sent via `ioctl(fd, CMD, &arg)`, where `fd` is the file descriptor for `/dev/hymo_ctl`.

#### 1. Clear
Resets all rules and invalidates internal caches.
*   **IOCTL**: `HYMO_IOC_CLEAR_ALL`
*   **Argument**: None
*   **Effect**: Clears all hash tables (redirects, hides, injections) and increments the internal version counter (`hymo_version`).

#### 2. Add (Redirect)
Redirects access from a source path to a target path.
*   **IOCTL**: `HYMO_IOC_ADD_RULE`
*   **Argument**: `struct hymo_ioctl_arg`
    *   `src`: Source path string pointer
    *   `target`: Target path string pointer
    *   `type`: File type (DT_DIR=4, DT_REG=8, etc.)
*   **Mechanism**: Hooks `getname_flags` in `fs/namei.c`. When a process requests `/source/path`, the kernel transparently swaps it for `/target/path`.

#### 3. Hide
Completely hides a path from the system.
*   **IOCTL**: `HYMO_IOC_HIDE_RULE`
*   **Argument**: `struct hymo_ioctl_arg`
    *   `src`: Path to hide
*   **Effect**:
    *   **Access**: Returns `-ENOENT` (No such file or directory) when accessed via `open`, `access`, etc.
    *   **Listing**: Filters the entry out during `readdir` operations, making it invisible to `ls`.

#### 4. Auto-Injection (Internal)
Automatically enables "Ghost" files in a directory listing when a redirect rule is added for a non-existent file.
*   **Mechanism**:
    *   **Trigger**: When `add` is called, if the source path does not exist, HymoFS automatically identifies the parent directory and adds it to an internal injection list.
    *   **Listing**: Hooks `getdents/getdents64`. After the real directory entries are listed, HymoFS artificially appends entries defined by `add` rules that reside within this directory.
    *   **Mtime Spoofing**: Hooks `vfs_getattr` in `fs/stat.c`. Forces the directory's modification time (`mtime`) and change time (`ctime`) to report the current system time.

#### 5. Delete
Removes a specific rule (redirect or hide) by its key path.

*   **Effect**: Searches all hash tables (`hymo_paths`, `hymo_hide_paths`, `hymo_inject_dirs`) for the given key and removes the entry if found.
*   **Key Path**:
    *   For **Add** rules: Use the *source* path (e.g., `/system/app/YouTube`).
    *   For **Hide** rules: Use the *target* path (e.g., `/system/app/Bloatware`).
    *   **Note**: Injection rules are managed automatically and cleaned up when the corresponding redirect rule is deleted.
*   **IOCTL**: `HYMO_IOC_DEL_RULE`
*   **Argument**: `struct hymo_ioctl_arg`
    *   `src`: Key path of the rule
*   **Effect**: Searches all hash tables for the given key and removes the entry.

#### 6. List (List Rules)
Retrieves a list of all currently active rules.
*   **Operation**: `read()` system call
*   **Mechanism**: Directly reads from the `/dev/hymo_ctl` device file. The kernel generates text-formatted data containing all rules.
*   **Format**:
    ```text
    HymoFS Protocol: 4
    HymoFS Config Version: 123
    add /source /target 8
    hide /path/to/hide
    inject /path/to/inject
    ```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Architecture Design
*   **hymofs_ioctl.h**: Defines the User API (UAPI), including `ioctl` command codes and data structures. Userspace tools only need to include this header.
*   **hymofs.h**: Kernel module internal implementation header, containing kernel data structures and function declarations.
*   **hymofs.c**: Core logic implementation, including character device registration, ioctl handling, hash table management, etc.

### 2. Path Resolution Hook (`fs/namei.c`)
*   **Function**: `getname_flags`
*   **Logic**:
    1.  **Hide Check**: Checks if the resolved filename is in the `hymo_hide_paths` hash table. If found, it immediately returns `ERR_PTR(-ENOENT)`.
    2.  **Redirect Check**: Checks if the filename is in the `hymo_paths` hash table. If found, it resolves the target path and restarts the lookup with the new path (`getname_kernel`).

### 3. Directory Listing Hook (`fs/readdir.c`)
*   **Functions**: `filldir`, `filldir64`, `getdents`, `getdents64`
*   **Hiding**: Inside the `filldir` callback, it checks if the current entry name (combined with the directory path) matches a hidden path. If so, it returns `true` without copying data to the user buffer.
*   **Injection**:
    *   Uses a "Magic Position" constant: `HYMO_MAGIC_POS` (`0x7000000000000000ULL`).
    *   When the standard directory listing finishes, HymoFS takes over, calling `hymofs_populate_injected_list` to scan and inject "ghost" entries.

### 4. Attribute Hook (`fs/stat.c`)
*   **Function**: `vfs_getattr_nosec`
*   **Logic**: If the directory is in the **Inject List**, the kernel overwrites the returned `mtime` and `ctime` with `ktime_get_real_ts64()` to ensure applications perceive the directory content change.

## Data Structures
*   **Hash Tables**: Uses `DEFINE_HASHTABLE` with 10 bits (1024 buckets) for fast lookups.
*   **Concurrency**: Protected by a global spinlock `hymo_lock`.
*   **Memory Management**: Uses `vmalloc` for large buffer allocations (e.g., for `read` operations) to ensure stability.
